/**
 * The spring RestTemplate class is, by nature, blocking.
 * Consequently, we do not want to use it in a reactive application.
 * For reactive applications, Spring offers the WebClient class,
 * which is non-blocking. We use a WebClient-based implementation
 * to consumer our RESTful service
 *
 * The WebClient class uses reactive features, in the form of a Mono to hold the content of
 * the message (returned by the getMessage method). This is using a function API, rather than
 * an imperative one, to chain reactive operations.
 *
 * It can take time to get used to Reactive APIs, but the WebClient has interesting features
 * and can also be used in traditional Spring MVC applications
